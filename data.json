			"bio": "Professor Rubin received her PhD in Jurisprudence and Social Policy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2013 and joined the University of Toronto in 2016. She teaches courses in crime and socio-legal studies and organizational theory.\n\nHer current research reexamines the dynamics of penal change, focusing on the introduction of new punishments in America and England from the seventeenth century through the early twentieth century. Her interdisciplinary research draws on neo-institutional theory, the law and society literature, and socio-historical studies of punishment. She has projects exploring the uses of penal incarceration before first state prisons, the rise and decline of the proto-prison and modern prison, and the effect of prison authorizations on existing punishments in the United States. Her research also examines the theoretical consequences of analyzing prisons as organizations, including recognizing the dynamics of the diffusion of penal innovations, the tension between organizational concerns and penal goals, and the professionalization efforts of early prison administrators.\n\nShe is currently writing a monograph on Eastern State Penitentiary (opened in 1829 in Philadelphia, PA, USA) that explores the role of prison administrators in securing that historic prisonâ€™s rejection of field-wide norms despite intense criticism and pressures to the contrary. She has additional projects that focus on prisoners and their experience of and relationship to the prison regime; these projects focus on the causes and consequences of that behavior frequently described as resistance. \n\nHer research can be found in the Law & Society Review, Law & Social\n\nInquiry, Punishment & Society, and Theoretical Criminology, among other outlets.",

Diane travels to the war-torn Republic of Cordovia to make a difference, but discovers that this life is not for her. Ashamed of returning to her husband, she develops a severe bout of depression, during which she drinks heavily and sleeps disheveled on BoJack's patio furniture. She is able to reconcile her feelings with Mr. Peanutbutter and gets a job at VIM ghostwriting tweets for celebrities. She is subsequently fired from VIM, and is hired to write for a feminist blog.\n\nDuring and after Mr. Peanutbutter's run for Governor of California their marriage begins to deteriorate and, at the beginning of Season 5, they divorce.",

			"name": "Mr. Peanutbutter",
			"bio": "Mr. Peanutbutter is an energetic and cheerful yellow Labrador Retriever who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's boyfriend (and later husband). Mr. Peanutbutter was the star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House, which, according to BoJack, \"borrowed the premise\" from Horsin' Around. He portrays many characteristics of a actual labrador yet portrayed as a human like character being sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate.\n\nHe had a stint at filming a celebrity reality show called Peanutbutter and Jelly. Despite their rivalry, Mr. Peanutbutter cares a great deal about BoJack's opinion and admires him for his work on Horsin' Around. He has an especially good relationship with Todd, and his positive attitude and financial resources combined with Todd's outlandish schemes and plans often result in the two starting questionable business ventures, such as a Halloween store that is exclusively open in January.\n\nIn the episode \"Let's Find Out\", Mr. Peanutbutter starts hosting his own televised game show after his film company enters bankruptcy due to his and Todd's extensive expenditures on useless products. In \"Hank After Dark\", it is revealed that Mr. Peanutbutter was formerly married to a woman named Katrina who was emotionally abusive. His second wife was famous actress Jessica Biel, who is portrayed as being obsessed with her celebrity status and people recognizing her.\n\nHe grew up in the Labrador Peninsula, which is depicted as being populated entirely by Labrador Retrievers. \"Mr.\" is his actual first name. He often shouts to an offscreen, but implicatively outlandish, presence only known as \"Erica\". He is a graduate of Northwestern University.\n\nAfter his divorce with Diane, he started dating a pug named Pickles who is much younger than him but shares a lot of the same characteristics. At the end of the season 5 finale, he proposes to her.",

			"name": "Todd Chavez",
			"bio": "Todd Chavez is a friendly and lovable human slacker who ended up at BoJack's house for a party five years before the beginning of the series and never left. Although BoJack constantly voices disdain for him, he secretly cares about Todd, continuing to financially support him and sabotage his attempts to gain independence.\n\nTodd has been shown to possess a plethora of skills including an understanding of Japanese; entrepreneurial know-how, having allied with Mr. Peanutbutter for various business ideas; and writing and composing his own rock opera- Newtopia Rising, Book I: The Search for a New Utopia. His rock opera was eventually sabotaged by BoJack, who took advantage of his former addiction to video games. Todd puts the pieces together of what BoJack did string map style and begins to question his friendship with BoJack.\n\nTodd also has an uncanny knack for getting himself in absurd and extremely dangerous situations when his friends aren't around, such as getting into gun fights on several occasions, ending up in prison, and in one case switching places Prince and the Pauper-style with a Cordovian dictator. Todd's friendship with Mr. Peanutbutter landed him various jobs creating seemingly useless products. He sees the best in BoJack, despite his multitude of problems, up until \"It's You\" in season three, where he ultimately decides to cut BoJack out of his life. He's usually happy, even when being insulted by BoJack.\n\nCatch Phrases include shouting \"hooray!\". He is also almost never seen without wearing his signature yellow beanie. In the 2000s he was an aimless skateboarder, and the object of affection of his schoolmate, Emily. It is revealed in the season 3 finale \"That Went Well\" that he is asexual.",
